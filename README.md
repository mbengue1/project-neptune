# AI‑Driven Sports Betting Application — Reference Documentation

Welcome to the **Neptune AI Sportsbook** project!  This repository contains the reference architecture, design rationale, and implementation guidelines for building a **cloud‑native, AI‑powered sports‑betting platform** that is secure, compliant, and ready to scale globally.

## High‑Level Architecture

A modern sportsbook must **react to live events in milliseconds**, keep user funds safe, and deliver personalized insights.  Our architecture embraces:

* **Event‑Driven Microservices** — decoupled services communicate via a message bus, ensuring resilience and horizontal scalability.
* **AI‑Enhanced Decision Making** — predictive models continuously ingest real‑time sports feeds to generate dynamic odds and user‑specific recommendations.
* **Hybrid Compute** — containerized services run on Kubernetes for always‑on workloads, while serverless functions handle bursty or scheduled jobs such as nightly reports or promotional e‑mails.

## Why a Hybrid Microservices Approach?

1. **Autonomous Scalability** — Services that perform GPU‑heavy inference (AI/ML) scale independently from the transaction‑heavy betting engine.
2. **Polyglot Freedom** — Teams choose the best language for the job: Python for data science, Go for high‑throughput bet settlement, Node.js for real‑time websockets.
3. **Blast‑Radius Isolation** — A failure in the chat service cannot impact payment processing.
4. **Cost Efficiency** — Serverless tasks (e.g., sending daily risk reports) incur zero cost when idle.

> **Alternatives considered:** A monolith was rejected due to limited elasticity, and fully serverless was deemed impractical for long‑running websocket sessions.

## Detailed Microservices Design

*(The following expands on the original outline with typical tech‑stack choices and data contracts.)*

### A. API Gateway
* **Recommended Tooling:**  Kong or AWS API Gateway + Lambda authorizers.
* **Cross‑Cutting Concerns:**  rate‑limiting, JWT validation, and synthetic monitoring probes.

### B. Auth & User Service
* **Zero‑Trust Posture:**  every request is authenticated, even internal gRPC calls.
* **KYC Pipeline:**  integrates with SumSub or Onfido via an async webhook; user state transitions from `pending` → `verified` → `restricted`.

### C. Betting Engine
* **Atomicity:**  bets are stored using a *double‑entry ledger* pattern to guarantee that every stake has a balancing liability.
* **Hot Path Optimizations:**  odds caches in Redis with pub/sub invalidation keep latency <10 ms.

### D. Payment/Transaction Service
* **Ledger Database:**  PostgreSQL with serializable isolation; every transaction is immutable and auditable.
* **Withdrawal Orchestration:**  Saga pattern coordinates KYC check → fraud scoring → payout execution.

### E. AI/ML Service
* **Model Registry:**  MLflow stores versioned models and metrics; Canary deployments route 5 % of traffic to new models.
* **Feature Store:**  Feast on BigQuery provides offline/online parity.

### F. Chat/LLM Service
* **Prompt Engineering Gateway:**  a thin Python layer injects user context (favorite teams, bankroll) before calling the LLM.
* **Guardrails:**  OpenAI function calling and semantic filters block disallowed content or wagering advice for underage users.

### G. Data Ingestion Service
* **Change Data Capture (CDC):**  Debezium streams odds changes into Kafka topics that power both the betting engine and analytics warehouse.

## Infrastructure & Deployment

| Layer | Technology | Reason |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Orchestration | **Kubernetes** on EKS / GKE | Mature ecosystem and autoscaling |
| CI/CD | **GitHub Actions** → Argo CD | GitOps deployment, progressive delivery |
| Observability | **Prometheus** + Grafana, **Jaeger** tracing | Unified SLO dashboards |
| Secrets | **HashiCorp Vault** or AWS Secrets Manager | Encryption & rotation |

> **Infrastructure‑as‑Code:**  Terraform modules in `/infra` provision all cloud resources with a single `terraform apply`.

---

## Observability & Monitoring

Beyond basic metrics, we enforce **SLO‑driven development**:

* **User‑Facing Latency (P99)** — < 200 ms for `/bets/place`.
* **Inference Success Rate** — ≥ 99.5 % for AI predictions.
* **End‑to‑End Trace ID** — every request carries a `trace‑id` header to correlate logs, metrics, and spans.

---

## Security & Compliance

* **Regulatory Footprint** — supports UKGC, MGA, and various U.S. state regulations; region‑specific rules are toggled via feature flags.
* **Anti‑Money‑Laundering (AML)** — transaction monitoring jobs flag suspicious patterns and file SARs automatically.
* **Responsible Gambling APIs** — self‑exclusion lists, deposit limits, and cool‑off periods enforced at the gateway.

---

## Step‑by‑Step Development Strategy

1. **Bootstrapping (Week 0‑2)** — scaffold services with OpenAPI specs, stand‑up CI, and deploy to a shared dev cluster.
2. **MVP (Week 3‑6)** — basic bet placement, manual odds entry, simple logistic‑regression model for win probability.
3. **Alpha (Week 7‑12)** — integrate live data feed, add payment sandbox, enable LLM‑based support chatbot.
4. **Beta (Week 13‑18)** — scale‑testing, security audit, and closed beta with power users.
5. **GA (Week 19+)** — public launch, SLA monitoring, feature flags for A/B testing.

---

## Responsible Gambling & Ethics

We are committed to **fair play and user well‑being**:

* **Age Verification** — KYC is mandatory before the first deposit.
* **Loss Limits & Reality Checks** — configurable reminders alert users about time and money spent.
* **Transparent Odds** — all AI‑generated odds include a confidence interval so users understand uncertainty.
* **Bias Audits** — quarterly reviews ensure models do not systematically disadvantage specific teams or demographics.
