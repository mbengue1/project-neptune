## High-Level Architecture

A typical microservices setup for an **AI-driven sports betting application** may include:

- **API Gateway / Reverse Proxy**:  
  - Single entry point for routing requests (e.g., Kong, NGINX, AWS API Gateway, or Istio on Kubernetes).
- **Authentication & User Management Service**:  
  - Handles user registration, login, profile management, and KYC.
  - Stores user details, sessions, permissions.
- **Betting Engine Service**:  
  - Handles betting logic, bet placement, outcomes, odds updates, and transaction logic.
- **Payments/Transactions Service**:  
  - Integrates with payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal, etc.) for deposits/withdrawals.
  - Manages user balances and transaction history.
- **AI/ML Service**:  
  - Provides predictions, recommended bets, personalized suggestions.
  - Commonly built with Python (FastAPI/Flask) for data science tasks.
- **Chat/Recommendation Service (LLM)**:  
  - Handles conversational AI features, possibly integrated with large language models (LLMs).
- **Sports Data Ingestion Service (Optional)**:  
  - Pulls data from external providers (e.g., Sportradar), normalizes, and publishes to internal services.

### Frontend & Databases
- **Frontends**: Mobile apps (iOS/Android with React Native, Flutter) and web apps (React, Vue, Angular).
- **Databases & Storage**:
  - **Relational DB** (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) for user, transaction, bet records.
  - **NoSQL** (e.g., MongoDB, DynamoDB) for high-volume logs or flexible documents.
  - **In-memory Cache** (e.g., Redis) for fast retrieval of odds, live event data.
  - **Data Warehouse/Lake** (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery, S3-based) for historical analytics and training data.

## Why a Hybrid Microservices Approach?

1. **Autonomous Scalability**  
   - Each service scales independently; AI might need GPUs, betting engine might need high CPU concurrency.

2. **Technology Tailoring**  
   - Python for data science, Node.js for real-time connections, or Go for performance-critical components.

3. **Isolation & Reliability**  
   - Service failures do not bring down the entire system.

4. **Serverless Opportunities**  
   - Event-driven tasks (notifications, daily stats) can be handled by AWS Lambda / GCP Functions, reducing overhead.

## Detailed Microservices Design

### A. API Gateway
- **Routes**:
  - `/auth/*` → Auth Service  
  - `/users/*` → User Management  
  - `/bets/*` → Betting Engine  
  - `/payments/*` → Payments  
  - `/ai/*` → AI/ML Service  
  - `/chat/*` → Chat/LLM Service

- **Security**:
  - JWT or session token validation.
  - Rate limiting (particularly important for LLM endpoints).
  - CORS policies for web clients.

### B. Auth & User Service
- **Auth Flows**:
  - JWT-based or OAuth2.
  - Email/password, social logins (Google, Apple), etc.

- **Database**:
  - Relational table: `users(id, email, hashed_password, balance, ...)`.
  - Possibly a `user_activity_logs` table for KYC references and user actions.

- **Implementation**:
  - Node.js (Express/NestJS), Go, or .NET commonly used.

### C. Betting Engine
- **Core Functions**:
  - List sports/teams/matches with odds.
  - Place bets (bet tickets), track outcomes.
  - Settle bets (update user balances).
  
- **Data Flow**:
  - Consumes real-time odds from Ingestion service or external API.
  - Publishes bet outcomes to queue for asynchronous processing.

- **Performance**:
  - High concurrency expected around events. Horizontal scaling is critical.

### D. Payment/Transaction Service
- **Integrations**:
  - Payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal, etc.).
  - Crypto payments may require a separate wallet service.

- **Workflow**:
  - **Deposit** → gateway call → update user’s balance.
  - **Withdrawal** → KYC check → gateway call → update ledger → notify user.

- **Security**:
  - PCI-DSS compliance if handling card data.
  - Use tokenization to avoid storing raw card details.

### E. AI/ML Service
- **Sub-components**:
  - **Model Inference**: Predictive analytics for outcomes, performance, recommended bets.
  - **Data Processing**: Historical data prepping, possibly offline training jobs.

- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /predict` with match data, stats, etc.
  - `POST /recommend` for recommended bets.

- **Model Deployment**:
  - Typically Python-based (FastAPI, Flask, Gunicorn).
  - May use managed solutions like AWS Sagemaker or GCP AI Platform.

- **Caching**:
  - For frequently repeated inferences, store results to avoid recomputation.

### F. Chat/LLM Service
- **Approaches**:
  - **Self-Hosted**: More control, but requires GPU infra.
  - **Third-Party API**: (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) Quicker setup but less control.

- **Functionality**:
  - `POST /chat` with user query + context (game info, user preferences).

- **Rate Limiting & Costs**:
  - Chat can be a big cost driver; implement usage tracking, caching, or membership tiers.

### G. Data Ingestion Service
- **Task**:
  - Fetch/subscribe to external sports data (e.g., Sportradar).
  - Parse, normalize, store in DB/cache.
  - Publish real-time updates to Betting Engine (queue or direct push).

- **Serverless Option**:
  - If on a schedule or event-driven, can use AWS Lambda / GCP Cloud Functions.

---

## Infrastructure & Deployment

### A. Containers
- **Docker** for each microservice.
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes, AWS ECS, or Docker Swarm.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins pipelines.

### B. Serverless Components
- **AWS Lambda / GCP Cloud Functions / Azure Functions** for:
  - Email notifications.
  - Report generation.
  - Scheduled data ingestion.
  - Logging tasks or data cleanup.

### C. Message Broker / Event Bus
- **Kafka, RabbitMQ, or AWS SQS** to decouple services:
  - Example: Betting Engine publishes “BetSettled” → Payment service processes payout → Notification service sends user updates.

### D. CI/CD
- Each microservice in a separate repository or a monorepo.
- On push:
  1. Run tests.
  2. Build Docker image.
  3. Push image to registry.
  4. Deploy to staging/production with rolling or blue-green updates.

---

## Observability & Monitoring

1. **Logging**:  
   - Aggregate logs in ELK (Elastic Stack), Splunk, or Datadog.

2. **Metrics**:  
   - Use Prometheus + Grafana or a managed service (Datadog, New Relic) for CPU, memory, request latency metrics.

3. **Tracing**:  
   - Distributed tracing with Jaeger, Zipkin, or built-in APM tools in Datadog/New Relic.

---

## Security & Compliance

1. **Secure Communication**:  
   - Enforce TLS/HTTPS.  
   - Optional mTLS for internal microservice communication.

2. **Access Control**:  
   - Validate JWTs or tokens from Auth service across all microservices.

3. **Regulatory Considerations**:  
   - Gambling license requirements per region.  
   - Data privacy (GDPR in EU, US state-specific laws).

4. **Data Encryption**:  
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest.  
   - Use AWS KMS or HashiCorp Vault for key management.

---

## Step-by-Step Development Strategy

1. **Start with Core Services**:
   - Authentication/User Service + Payment Service + Betting Engine + minimal Data Ingestion.  
   - Define clear endpoints and contracts (OpenAPI or gRPC).

2. **Implement Basic AI**:
   - Create a simple ML or rules-based recommendation system.
   - Expose `/recommend` in an AI microservice.

3. **Add Chat/LLM**:
   - Integrate an external LLM provider (OpenAI, Cohere, etc.) for quick prototyping.
   - Provide `/chat` endpoint that incorporates domain logic.

4. **Enhance Real-Time Capabilities**:
   - Implement WebSockets or Server-Sent Events for live odds updates.

5. **Refine & Scale**:
   - Migrate batch tasks or data analytics to serverless if needed.
   - Containerize all microservices and deploy with Kubernetes for elasticity.

6. **Observability & Performance Tuning**:
   - Add robust logging, metrics, and distributed tracing.
   - Identify bottlenecks (AI inference latency, concurrency on betting) and optimize or add compute resources.

7. **Continuous Improvement**:
   - Advanced ML (deep learning, ensemble methods).
   - Expand microservices for more sports or betting markets.
   - Improve Chat/LLM experience with personalization and synergy with predictive models.
