# Sports Data API Research & Integration Plan

## Current Status
- **Issue**: API-SPORTS.io v3 is not returning player data despite successful authentication
- **Problem**: All player searches return 0 results, even for common players like Haaland, Messi, etc.
- **Impact**: AI chat cannot provide real sports data, falling back to mock data

## Research Objectives

### 1. Alternative Sports Data APIs
Research and evaluate alternative APIs for comprehensive sports data:

#### Primary Candidates:
- **ESPN API** - Free tier available, comprehensive coverage
- **TheSportsDB** - Free API with good football coverage
- **Football-Data.org** - Specialized in football data
- **RapidAPI Sports Hub** - Multiple sports APIs in one platform
- **OpenLigaDB** - German football focus but good structure
- **API-Football (Alternative)** - Different provider than current
- **Sports Reference APIs** - Historical and current data

#### Evaluation Criteria:
- [ ] **Cost**: Free tier limits and pricing structure
- [ ] **Coverage**: Premier League, major European leagues
- [ ] **Data Quality**: Player stats, team data, fixtures
- [ ] **Rate Limits**: Requests per minute/hour/day
- [ ] **Documentation**: API documentation quality
- [ ] **Reliability**: Uptime and response consistency
- [ ] **Real-time Data**: Live scores, current season data
- [ ] **Historical Data**: Past seasons and player statistics

### 2. Current API Issues Analysis
Investigate why API-SPORTS.io v3 is not working:

#### Technical Investigation:
- [ ] Verify API key validity and permissions
- [ ] Test different parameter combinations
- [ ] Check if API requires different authentication method
- [ ] Validate endpoint URLs and parameter names
- [ ] Test with different seasons (2023, 2024, 2025)
- [ ] Check if API has data for requested leagues/players

#### Debugging Steps:
1. Test API status endpoint
2. Try different player search parameters
3. Test with different leagues and seasons
4. Check API response structure
5. Verify rate limiting and quotas

### 3. GPT Model Flow Improvements

#### Current Issues:
- Model relies on tool calling for data retrieval
- Fallback to mock data when API fails
- Limited context about player performance trends
- No integration with betting odds or market data

#### Proposed Improvements:

##### A. Enhanced Data Retrieval Strategy
- **Multi-API Fallback**: Primary API + 2 backup APIs
- **Caching Layer**: Redis/Memory cache for frequently requested data
- **Data Aggregation**: Combine multiple sources for comprehensive stats
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections for live data

##### B. Improved Tool Schema Design
```javascript
// Proposed tool structure
{
  "getPlayerStats": {
    "description": "Get comprehensive player statistics",
    "parameters": {
      "playerName": "string",
      "league": "string", 
      "season": "string",
      "includeTrends": "boolean",
      "includeOdds": "boolean"
    }
  },
  "getTeamStats": {
    "description": "Get team performance data",
    "parameters": {
      "teamName": "string",
      "league": "string",
      "season": "string",
      "includeFixtures": "boolean"
    }
  },
  "getBettingInsights": {
    "description": "Get betting recommendations based on data",
    "parameters": {
      "playerName": "string",
      "betType": "string",
      "timeframe": "string"
    }
  }
}
```

##### C. Context-Aware Responses
- **Player Performance Trends**: Last 5, 10, 20 games analysis
- **Head-to-Head Records**: Player vs specific teams
- **Form Analysis**: Recent performance patterns
- **Injury Reports**: Current player availability
- **Weather Impact**: Environmental factors for outdoor sports
